# Quick Start
This quick start guide will walk you through the basics of how to start creating programs for TBundlr.

When following this guide, it is assumed you have a basic understanding of [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Types of Programs
There are two types of programs you can load using TBundlr:

- Script: A simple Javascript file that gets loaded into the main window.
- Embed: A webpage that gets embedded within the main page and communicates with the main window.

Both of these can be loaded as TBundlr specific (using a `tbundlr-config.json` file), or as a standard file/webpage.

## Creating an Embed
<Steps>

### Find or Create a Project
To start, open the main file of the webpage you want to embed.

For this example a blank HTML page will be used.
```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>TBundlr Embed</title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
<script></script>
```

### Add Event Listener
Next, we'll:

1. Add an event listener for `message` to the window.
2. Create a JSON object for storing event functions.
3. Create an event function for `tbundlr_event:-:loaded_program`.

This setup is to keep the events organized, however, you may call the events a different way if you prefer.

```html {12-25} showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>TBundlr Embed</title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
<script>
  window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
    if (InteropEvents[e.data.cmd]) InteropEvents[e.data.cmd](e.data);
  })

  const InteropEvents = {
    /* Called when your program finishes loading. */
    "tbundlr_event:-:loaded_program": (data) => {
      console.log("[TBundlr Embed PID] " + data.pid) 
      /*               ^^^
       * PIDs (Program Identifiers) are used to identify and authenticate
       * programs during interop communication. Store this somewhere for later!
      */
    }
  }
</script>
```

### Save and Upload
Save your website and ensure it's available online.

### Modify Tumblr Page
Open the HTML editor for your Tumblr page and add a script tag pointing to `https://tbundlr.rayk.cc/dist/tbundlr.js`

```html {5} showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  ...
</html>
<script src="https://tbundlr.rayk.cc/dist/tbundlr.js"></script>
```

Then, add another script tag with the following code, replacing `<url>` with the url of your webpage:
```html {6-16} showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  ...
</html>
<script src="https://tbundlr.rayk.cc/dist/tbundlr.js"></script>
<script>
  const tb = new tbundlr.TBundlr();

  tb.execute(
    new URL("<url>"), // Replace <url> with the url of your webpage.
    options: { 
      parent: document.body // Set this to the element you want your embed to be in.
      interop: true // Allows your embed to communicate with the main window.
    }
  );
</script>
```

### Save and Profit!
You've now implemented TBundlr and should see your embed's PID show up in the console when you load your page!
